# CDR (Critical Design Review)

This project contains a Ruby application with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that works as a Client. This connects to a local server programmed with NodeJS that works as an intermediary between it and a database programmed with MySQL, to collect the information requested by the client and send it back.

For the correct operation, the server must first be run with the following command: `node server.js`

The client is then run with the following: `ruby interficie.rb`
