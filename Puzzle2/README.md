# Puzzle2
The _puzzle2.rb_ file contains the Ruby code that, working with GTK3 User Interface, reads an RFID while using the Itead PN532 NFC RFID module.

For the correct operation of the application, the Ruby gem _gtk3_ is essential. 
Make sure you have the Ruby development package installed before installing the Ruby gem _gtk3_.

`sudo apt-get install ruby-dev`

`sudo gem install gtk3`

In addition, this application requires the use of _Threads_, and can be styled by using _CSS_.
